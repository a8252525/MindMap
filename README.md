# MindMap in python
Read from this [website](https://pythonprogramming.altervista.org/mind-map-with-python/)
I don't know where to store mind map, and do not want to use another app for mindmap.
I believe that github is the best place for software engineer.
Will keep the habit if it is useful and convenient.
